This is the simplest form of implementing the Contact Us Page tests using Selenium Web driver.
Also we can parameterise the tests and assertion of values accordingly using case examples. 
I haven't had time to look into this unfortunately today but I can certainly do that without issues.
This test is currently built on IE browser using IEWebdriver.
We can automate the same tests to run on multiple browsers like Firefox, Chrome etc., given we configure
 the webdrivers accordingly.
 Also, I am currently automating a very single page here.. However, if we want to automate all the 
 pages of this application, we can implement page objects model and get objects clearly defined for every page
 and define methods appropriately and automate each page individually.
 We can integrate this project to a CI tool like Jenkins or TeamCity and get it running on Selenium Grid too.
